- ### Adaptive Layout and Styled Components <br>

  The main topics of this section are adaptive layout and styled components. We are building the hero section. First, we have a card and then, we have a stack that contains a logo, some text, and a purchase button.

- ### Basic Hooks <br>

  In this section, we're going to talk about hooks and how to use them to trigger an animation. The main focus on this section is the course card.

- ### Custom Hooks <br>

  This section is about custom hooks. We're going to create our own custom hook and apply it to a static design. As the mouse hovers over a component, the hook retrieves the x and y positions of the mouse and applies some transformations to the component.

- ### Hooks Libraries <br>

  In this section, we will discuss about React Hooks Libraries. You may prefer to use hooks libraries instead of coding a custom hook as we did in the previous section.

- ### Grid Layout <br>

  In this section, we will design rows and add them to a grid layout. It is possible to use grids to provide structure to different types of websites, including blogs, portfolio websites, news websites, and social networking sites. The grid layout is a set of rows and columns that helps web page designers design without having to use positioning and floats.

- ### Static Data <br>

  The purpose of this section is to discuss static data. We created a section row in the previous section, and we clearly have a problem since they all have the same title, description, and timestamp. Since it is hardcoded, it is normal. We will use props, statically loaded data, and map method.
